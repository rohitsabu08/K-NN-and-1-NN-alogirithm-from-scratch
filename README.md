# K-NN-and-1-NN-alogirithm-from-scratch
KNN Algorithm from scratch.

This repository explains the algorithm clearly from the scratch.

The classification of 1-NN and K-NN and also regression is performed without using any packages from the standard libraries.

The well known iris and cars dataset are used for the working of the algorithm.
